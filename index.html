<h1>QuaDramA Viewer</h1>

<h2>Details</h2>

<h3>Text View</h3>
<p>The dramatic text itself. Currently, stage directions are not displayed in this view. The view shows only text spoken by a figure. Using the sidebar, you can jump to acts/scenes and/or highlight figures.</p>

<h3>Presence View</h3>
<p>An interactive version of a configuration matrix. Every utterance is represented in the chart. It allows a quick glance at co-presence of figures and even displays the spoken text when hovering.</p>

<h3>Presence View2</h3>
<p>An other view on the co-presence of figures. It shows relative portions of spoken words by scene / act.</p>

<h3>Figure Statistics</h3>
<p>Some simple, descriptive metrics on each figure</p>

<h3>Semantic Fields</h3>
<p>Using manually constructed dictionaries, we assign a topical score to each figure. The score represents the amount of spoken tokens from a particular topic. </p>

<h3>Copresence Network</h3>
<p>Interactive co-presence network. Node size is based on amount of spoken tokens per figure. Width of connection represents the (normalized) number of co-present scenes the two figures have.</p>
